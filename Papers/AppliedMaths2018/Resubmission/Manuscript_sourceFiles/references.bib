abstract="AbstractThis paper discusses the practical problem of estimating a single equivalentpermeability for an oil reservoir, or a portion thereof, whose actualpermeability varies in an irregular manner. Limiting averages for general typesof permeability. variation are developed, and illustrated by examples involvingimportant, specific types of variation.IntroductionThe theory of the flow of fluids through porous media is becoming increasinglyimportant in predictions of oil-reservoir behavior. In practical applications,however, reservoirs are seldom found .to which simple theory strictly applies.Actual reservoirs have complicated shapes and non-uniform permeabilities andporosities.This paper discusses the problem of estimating a single equivalent permeabilityfor an oil reservoir, or a segment of an oil reservoir, whose actualpermeability varies in an irregular manner. The equivalent permeability of areservoir segment is defined as the permeability of a homogeneous segment ofthe same dimensions that would pass the same flux under the same pressure drop.It is the permeability value that can be used in simple theoretical formulas tocalculate the reservoir behavior.To the authors' knowledge, previous theoretical calculations on systems ofnon-uniform permeability have been carried out only by Muskat and he has notdealt with irregular variations, except in writing down the generaldifferential equation for the pressure in variably permeable systems. aIn practical work, many calculations necessarily have been made to estimateequivalent permeabilities from the permeability profiles obtained by coreanalyses. Regarding such calculations, Johnston and Sherborne say:Simple arithmetic and weighted averages have been tried on many wells and ithas been found that, where frequent sampling has occurred, the arithmeticaverage is as satisfactory as a weighted average. It is possible that theapplication of statistical methods to the analysis of permeability data asrecently presented by Laws may prove fruitful.Law has made a valuable contribution in showing how statistical analyses mayaid in picturing the characteristics of a reservoir from those of a necessarily limited number of core samples. It is believed however that the particularproblem of the estimation of equivalent permeabilities can be most directlyapproached from a fluid dynamical viewpoint as given in the present paper. Anexample is presented of the use of the conclusions herein in conjunction withLaw's method.T.P. 1852",

abstract = "The ability to numerically simulate single phase and multiphase flow of fluids in porous media is extremely important in developing an understanding of the complex phenomena governing the flow. The flow is complicated by the presence of heterogeneities in the reservoir at many different length scales and by phenomena such as diffusion and dispersion. These effects must be effectively modeled by terms in coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which form the basis of the simulator. The simulator must be able to model both single and multiphase flows and the transition regimes between the two in unsaturated flow applications. A discussion of some of the aspects of modeling unsaturated and multiphase flows in the presence of heterogeneities and channeling is presented along with directions for future work.

abstract={In this paper, we introduce PVL, an algorithm for computing the Pade approximation of Laplace-domain transfer functions of large linear networks via a Lanczos process. The PVL algorithm has significantly superior numerical stability, while retaining the same efficiency as algorithms that compute the Pade approximation directly through moment matching, such as AWE and its derivatives. As a consequence, it produces more accurate and higher-order approximations, and it renders unnecessary many of the heuristics that AWE and its derivatives had to employ. The algorithm also computes an error bound that permits to identify the true poles and zeros of the original network. We present results of numerical experiments with the PVL algorithm for several large examples},

abstract="In this paper we briefly discuss the background to the problems of finding effective flow properties when moving from a detailed representation of reservoir geology to a coarse gridded model required for reservoir performance simulation. The basic requirements for the upscaled properties are also discussed. We then consider one technique, renormalization, that in recent years has shown promise as an accurate, yet fast, method. The mathematical background of the renormalization approach is examined. A rigorous formalism is developed that allows an explicit calculation of the error terms to be made. In a very simple case use of the correction terms is shown to produce a dramatic improvement in accuracy of the method.",

abstract="The accuracy of the renormalization method for upscaling two-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields is investigated, using two canonical 2 {\texttimes} 2 blocks: a checkerboard geometry and a geometry in which three of the cells have conductivity K1 and the other has conductivity K2. The predictions of the renormalization algorithm are compared to the arithmetic, harmonic and geometric means, as well as to theoretical predictions and finite element calculations. For the latter geometry renormalization works well over the entire range of the conductivity ratio K2/K1, but for the checkerboard geometry the error becomes unbounded as the conductivity ratio grows.",
